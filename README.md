# Collection of my personal color schemes for Geany

With `joede-geany-themes`, I've started to bundle my personal color schemes
for Geany into a collection. I've used the bright schemes for some years now,
but I want to switch to a dark GNOME theme.

I use *named colors* instead of the assignment of color codes. This way, the
configuration file is easier to read and the risk of (unwanted) similar colors
is reduced.

All of the themes comes with a sample image of the color palette. This file is
available inside the `tools` folder.


## Themes `joede-bright-bluish` and `joede-bright-paper`

The *bright schemes* differ in the color of the  background and the color of
the current line. The assignments of the colors to the styles is equal.

## Themes `joede-anthracite` and `joede-anthracite-2`

After playing with dark GNOME themes (ARC and global dard Adwaita), I've put
together a matching dark scheme. My main focus was a good but not too hard contrast
of colors and a less colorfull look and feel.

For `joede-anthracite-2`, I've played with *Orange* and *Cyan*. Most of the other
style assignments are unchanged. The color palette is equal.
